This folder contains the data and code for the analyses presented in Hardner et. al. (2022). 
Multi-environment genomic prediction for soluble solids content in peach (Prunus persica). Frontiers of Plant Science.

The analysis requires several R packages, most notably ASReml.

Phenotypic, genotypic and SNP map data is available under folder 0. Data. 
Also under this folder is a workspace for R )apdata_CV_temp.RData) that is required for the estimation of prediction accuracies (LOOCVxLAE). 
This is required to generate the exact same prediction accuracies presented in the paper as the random selection of the validation populations is defined. 
However, the code is not restricted to these validation populations.
